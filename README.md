# Edgar Allen Poe's language use in his gothic short stories<br>

**1. Corpus**<br>
The corpus contains four short stories written by the American author Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849): *The Assignation*, *The Black Cat*, *The Masque of the Red Death*, and *The Tell-Tale Heart*. These short stories constitute parts of Poe's gothic fiction.<br>

**2. Target audience and intended use of the corpus**<br>
The corpus can be used by anyone interested in Edgar Allan Poeâ€™s gothic literature, especially from the perspective of language use regarding this genre.<br>

**3. Text selection criteria**<br>
I aimed to select texts that can be downloaded as plain text files and that are openly accessible. I intended to gather short stories of the same genre, so that features of one specific style can be investigated and revealed through a series of texts. Another aspect I took into consideration is the limit of the number of word tokens (preferably not more than 10,000) stated in the instructions of Assignment 4. <br>

**4. Data collection process**<br>
I accessed the short stories through the Gutenberg project (https://www.gutenberg.org/), and downloaded them as plain text files with UTF-8 encoding. <br>
Source: https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2148<br>

**5. Cleaning and pre-processing steps**<br>
I removed extra spaces from the text files (see Jupyter Notebook).<br>

**6. Tools and annotations**<br>
I used pandas to create dataframes and spaCy to process, tokenize, lemmatize and annotate the short stories.<br>
I added part of speech category tags and named entity tags as annotations. <br>

**7. File format description**<br>
The files in the data directory are the four short stories as plain text files (poe_the assignation.txt, poe_the black cat.txt, poe_the masque of the red death.txt, poe_the tell-tale heart.txt). <br>

The repository also includes the following files: <br>
- the metadata about the short stories in a CSV file (metadata.csv) <br>
- the Jupyter Notebook (CD_Assignment4.ipynb) <br>
- the short stories annotated with the use of spaCy in a CSV file (poe_short_stories_with_spaCy_tags.csv) <br>

**8. Description of columns in the CSV file containing annotations**<br>

| Columns | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Filename | the name of the file |
| Author | the name of the author of the short story |
| Title | the title of the short story |
| Language | the language of the short story |
| Genre | the genre of the short story |
| First published | the year in which the short story was first published |

| POS | part of speech category tags |
| Proper_Nouns | words tagged as proper nouns |

**9. Quality checks** <br>
I checked whether there is a different number of occurrences of a verb as a token and as a lemma (see Jupyter Notebook).
